# Eink Bitcoin Price Ticker

This miniproject is about building easy to use application/webpage which shows actual price of Bitcoin in USD/EUR. The view is very simplistic, e-ink optimised (I build it primarily for my android based e-ink book reader Likebook Mars). Data are gathered from free to use API of Coinbase.

The idea is to build this ticker using various technologies even if the technology itself might be not most suitable for this kind of simple app (e.g. overkill). However, ultimate goal was to practice and learn these technologies.


## APP versions

### Java Spring Boot version
- Probably overkill, the goal was to practice Java and Spring Boot + Thymeleaf templates. Result is a Server-Side rendered web page, which is being auto-refreshed every x seconds. The project is hosted on Heroku servers.
